For iris classification
**Disclaimer 1** : Some text below is some note for myself since I just started learning basic machine learning by my own some are from Youtube course some from AI help and some from StackOverflow etc.
Source I learn from : [FreecodeCamp](https://youtu.be/i_LwzRVP7bg?si=1P-06dqk5WAu1Hb8
)

**Disclaimer 2** : I try a similar code learn from the source but try with other datasets and try change code to be able to work with this iris datasets such as label encoding since the target has 3 classes.

**Disclaimer 3** : This is for my university portfolio and **perhaps** portfolio for attending CAI camp.
